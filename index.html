          Mass media is a powerful political, economical, and social weapon. It is used to promote products, win elections, push scientific research, justify wars. Internet provides news readers and news producers with a real-time access to ever-growing amounts of diverse information, but it also poses significant challenges for the society. Popularity of social media (blogs and social networks) takes the monopoly on information distribution away from traditional media (newspapers and television). At the same time, it allows for quick distribution of false or unsubstantiated claims and biased news stories as well as for easier and imperceptible propagation of ideas by paid or ideologically driven groups of people.

          Social behaviour is influenced by opinions. In order to develop well-founded opinions, we need to be exposed to balanced credible information, we need to be aware of information manipulation and media bias.          </p>
          In this project, we aim at developing computational tools for media analysis available for the community, which can crucially help media scientists, journalists, and news readers to navigate in the ocean of news stories and opinions.
          Our goals are 1)~to facilitate researchers performing manual analysis of mass media by providing them with computational media analysis tools, 2)~to facilitate news producers by providing them with tools for information tracking and validation, 3)~to support news readers in discovering diverse viewpoints and being aware of information manipulation.
          Specifically, we work on developing the following tools.
        
          <h4>News life cycle detector</h4>
          <p>
            We propose a service that will detect a “life cycle” of a piece of news. It will allow news readers to track the piece of news back to it origins, see other citations of the original text together with the publishing source and the date of publishing.
          </p>


          <h4>Contradiction detector</h4>
          <p>
            Often news documents discussing the same topic may contain mutually contradicting statements. Furthermore, news statements can contradict historic, cultural, or scientific facts. Examples of such contradictions in the speeches of politicians are manually discovered and published by the <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck</a> project. In order to make it easier for the reader to decide whether to trust a particular news source, we aim at discovering these contradictions automatically and making them explicit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We propose a service that will detect all statements in a piece of text and find documents on the web that contain contradicting or supporting statements.
          </p>


          <h4>Bias detector</h4>
          <p>
            Different propaganda methods are used in the media: indirect statements, repetitions, half-true, logical mistakes, provocations, manipulations with emotions, etc. (cf. International Encyclopedia of Propaganda by Robert Cole). For example, the project <a href="http://www.medialens.org">Media Lens provides</a> a detailed analysis of news articles containing biased statements.
          </p>
          <p>
            We propose a service that will detect biased linguistic expressions in news texts and mark them with predefined propaganda class labels.
          </p>


          <h4>Perspective detector</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, given a news article, we'd like to visualize its life cycle, detect fact contradictions and bias in it and assign this article to a cluster of articles with a similar bias that represents interests of a certain social group: a political party, oil companies, bankers, environment activists, etc.
